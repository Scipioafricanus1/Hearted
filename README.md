Selling story: "This is Jerry, he's got 14 children and two dogs and they all are unique snowflakes. Ever since his wife died in a
fire, he's been trying to keep up with all their likes and dislikes. He tried writing it all down but found referring to the list to be
quite the pain. What can he do? Each list is different and he needs to keep up with all their likes and dislikes for meals, their
birthdays, and everything else. (ENTER: Burly man with a phone with app open) Burly man: Here, Jerry. This will make all your problems
disappear. Just have all your kids adopt the app and you can all finally get the meal you deserve.

Problems: Application might be a bit tedious if the categories aren't ordered well. Recommended categories will help with this.
